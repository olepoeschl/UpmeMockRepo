# UpmeTest

This repository does not contain any code and just exists to test a component of the [Upme library](https://github.com/olepoeschl/Upme). The component in question is the `GithubResolver`, which resolves all Releases of a Github repository with a specific asset that can serve as an update for the respective Java application.

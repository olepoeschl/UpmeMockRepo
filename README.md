# UpmeMockRepo

This is a mock repository and therefore does not contain any code. It only exists to test the `GithubResolver` component of the [Upme](https://github.com/olepoeschl/Upme) library, which resolves all Releases of a Github repository with a specific asset that can serve as an update for the respective Java application.
